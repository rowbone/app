1、ng-class
	1) scope 变量绑定
	class="{{ entity.bg }}"
	2) 字符串数组
	ng-class="{'bg-primary': entity.bg, 'bg-white': !entity.bg}"

	ng-class="{true: 'bg-primary', false: 'bg-white'}[entity.bg]"
	3) 对象 key/value
	ng-class {'selected': isSelected, 'car': isCar}

官方说明：
	The directive operates in three different ways, depending on which of three types the expression evaluates to:

	If the expression evaluates to a string, the string should be one or more space-delimited class names.
	ng-class="style"
	If the expression evaluates to an array, each element of the array should be a string that is one or more space-delimited class names.
	ng-class="[style1, style2, style3]"
	If the expression evaluates to an object, then for each key-value pair of the object with a truthy value the corresponding key is used as a class name.
	ng-class="{strike: deleted, bold: important, red: error}"
